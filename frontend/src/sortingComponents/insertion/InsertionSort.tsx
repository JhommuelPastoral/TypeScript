        <p>
          Insertion Sort is a simple and intuitive sorting algorithm that builds the final sorted array one element at a time. It works similarly to how you might sort playing cards: by picking each element and inserting it into its correct position in the already sorted portion.

        <p className="text-lg font-semibold">Complexity Analysis of Insertion Sort:</p>
        <p>Time Complexity: O(nÂ²)</p>
        <p>Best Case (nearly sorted): O(n)</p>
        <p>Space Complexity: O(1)</p>
        <p>Stability: Stable</p>
        <p>
          When to use: Best for small arrays or arrays that are already nearly sorted. Performs better than Bubble and Selection in these cases. It's also useful in real-time systems where data arrives over time.
